            <h2>Time Line</h2>
                <p>Eli Cohen was the Egyptian-born son of Aleppan Jews, who worked as a spy for Israeli intelligence, the Mossad. Cohen was born in 1924 in Alexandria, Egypt, to a devout Mizrahi Jewish and Zionist family. His father had moved there from Aleppo in 1914. A devout Jew, Cohen wore tefillin during prayer. In his youth he planned to become a rabbi with the backing of Moise Ventura (1893â€“1978), Chief Rabbi of Alexandria, but the yeshiva closed down. He studied at Cairo Farouk University. Cohen spoke five languages fluently.</p>

                  <p>Syrian officials, who used Soviet-made tracking equipment and were assisted by Soviet experts, increased their efforts to find a high-level spy. They observed a period of radio silence, in the hope that any illegal transmissions could be identified. They successfully detected radio transmissions and were able to triangulate the transmitter. Syrian security services led by Suidani broke into Cohen's apartment on 24 January and caught him in the middle of a transmission to Israel.
